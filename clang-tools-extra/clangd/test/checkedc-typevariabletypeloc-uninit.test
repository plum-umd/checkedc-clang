# Regression test for a bug where Parser::ParseForanySpecifierHelper left the
# memory representing the SourceLocation of the TypeVariableTypeLoc
# uninitialized (the second sub-issue of
# https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/issues/1066).

# The original symptom was that when a C file includes a header containing a
# _For_any or _Itype_for_any construct, clangd writes out a precompiled header
# with a garbage value for the SourceLocation, and when clangd reads the
# precompiled header back in, the bad SourceLocation causes an "offset overflow"
# assertion failure with TypeLocReader::VisitTypeVariableTypeLoc on the call
# stack. However, this is nondeterministic depending on the content of the
# uninitialized memory. To write a test that consistently catches the problem,
# we run clangd under valgrind memcheck and check for an uninitialized memory
# error. Alternatively, there might be a way to query the SourceLocation from
# clangd so we can check that it is actually correct, although conceivably this
# could falsely pass if the uninitialized memory coincidentally contained the
# correct value.

# Note that lit has a --vg command-line option to run test(s) under `valgrind
# --error-exitcode`, but there doesn't seem to be a way that we can force that
# option to be enabled just for this test, so we hard-code the valgrind command
# here. If valgrind isn't available on the system, the test will fail;
# effectively, we're requiring the user to install valgrind in order to run the
# clangd test suite. We consider this a lesser evil than automatically skipping
# the test if valgrind is unavailable, in which case users might not pay
# attention to the fact that they should run it at all.

# This test won't work correctly when run under a second level of valgrind via
# `lit --vg`, so treat it as unsupported in that case. Hopefully users don't run
# the test suite _only_ with --vg and forget to run this test.
# UNSUPPORTED: valgrind

# No good drop-in replacement for valgrind is currently available for Windows.
# UNSUPPORTED: system-windows

# Notes about command-line arguments:
#
# - Without --compile_args_from=lsp, clangd seems to automatically take
#   undesired compiler options from the LLVM monorepo's own compilation
#   database.
#
# - --path-mappings seems to be the easiest way to get the `#include` to resolve
#   to our desired header file in the Inputs directory, since lit expands %S
#   there but not in the uri in the actual LSP message. This is modeled on
#   path-mappings.test, although the purpose of path-mappings.test is actually
#   to test the path mapping, while here, we just use it to facilitate the
#   TypeVariableTypeLoc test.


# Notes on upgrade to LLVM/Clang 12.x:
#
# In LLVM/Clang 12.x, clangd has code in file TidyProvider.cpp that accesses
# uninitialized memory on lines 65 thro' 68 that is allocated in function
# read in file FileCache.cpp. This is happening when clangd is trying to
# read configuration data from .clang-tidy files, with caching. Valgrind
# reports this access of uninitialized memory, causing the test case to fail.
# Additionally, this issue is present only in the release build and not in the
# debug build.
# (Note: The above uninitialized memory access was not present in LLVM 11.x.)
#
# As this is a low priority issue for the Checked C Clang compiler, a temporary
# fix is made as follows:
# Valgrind is invoked with --track-origins=yes. If Valgrind reports any access
# of an uninitialized object, or allocation of an object any of whose fields may
# be uninitialized, or if Valgrind reports any other memory error detected by
# the --memcheck option such that the error is in a function invoked by the
# compiler frontend, then this test case will fail. If the issue reported by
# Valgrind is in a function not invoked by the compiler frontend, this test
# case will pass.
#
# TODO: Need to fix the above uninitialized memory access in clangd.
#
# RUN: valgrind --track-origins=yes clangd --compile_args_from=lsp --path-mappings '/test-workspace=%S/Inputs' -lit-test < %s 2>&1 | FileCheck %s
